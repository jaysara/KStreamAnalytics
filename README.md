# KStreamAnalytics

Assuming you have Kafka broker and Zookeeper running locally in your environment with default settings. Following topics need to be created to run this program.
## Topics needed to run the program
### Policy Paid Topic
This topic has sample events generated by ```PolicyEventGenerator``` class. 

```script
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic policyPaid
```

### Policy Analytic Topic
This topic will have a generated stream created by ```PolicyEventProcessor``` class.
```script
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic policyAnalytic
```
#### application.properites.
Make a note to how the binding to the actual Kafka topic happens through application.properties. The actual code still remains independant of your underlying messaging platform. This can bea strong design pattern over time.
